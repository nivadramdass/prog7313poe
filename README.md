# Budget Hero

Budget Hero is a minimalist, user-friendly Android budgeting app designed to help users efficiently track expenses, income, fixed expenses, and financial goals. The app uses a pastel-inspired color palette and a clear, accessible interface to make personal finance less intimidating and more actionable for students and young professionals.

## App Purpose

Budget Hero empowers users to take control of their finances with an intuitive dashboard, visualizations (bar charts, pie charts), and fast entry of daily transactions. Users can categorize income and expenses, set savings goals, monitor progress, and visually analyze their spending patterns over any selected time period. Design decisions focused on reducing clutter, making category selection seamless, and providing instant feedback on budget progress.

## Own Features

**1. Top 3 Frequent Expenses Visualization:**  
Budget Hero automatically identifies and displays your three most frequently recorded expense categories in a dedicated bar chart on the dashboard. This helps users quickly spot spending patterns and address recurring costs. The bar graph is clearly labeled and updates in real time as new transactions are added.

**2. Fixed Expenses Management & Reporting:**  
Users can add, edit, or remove fixed (recurring) monthly expenses (such as rent, subscriptions, or insurance) which are stored separately from variable expenses. These fixed expenses are integrated into all balance calculations, statements, and reports. Adjusting fixed expenses instantly updates your projected monthly balance and analytics, giving a clear picture of committed versus discretionary spending.

**3. Dark Mode Support:**  
Budget Hero includes a fully implemented dark mode theme. Users benefit from a modern, comfortable interface that adapts to system dark mode settings, reducing eye strain and improving usability at night or in low-light conditions.

## Demo Video

The demo was done in bluestacks 5 because I did not have access to a physical android device. It was incredibly hard trying to convince someone to install an apk on their phone so I used bluestacks 5.  I tried telling my family member how to install it over the phone, but then they would have had to do the demo, and I wanted to do it by myself.
